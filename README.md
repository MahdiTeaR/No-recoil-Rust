## 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE (As of June 2025)

The `Interception` driver, which is essential for this program, is now frequently blocked by major anti-cheat systems. As a result, the program **will not work correctly** under normal circumstances.

A temporary workaround has been found, but it requires careful execution and carries significant risk.

### Workaround & VERY IMPORTANT WARNING

1.  Before launching your game, you must rename the Interception driver files (`keyboard.sys`((to temp.sys)) and `mouse.sys`((to temp1.sys))).
2.  Launch the game.
3.  Once the game is fully running, you **MUST** rename the files back to their original names (`keyboard.sys`, `mouse.sys`).

> [!DANGER]
> **CRITICAL RISK**: IF YOU RESTART YOUR PC WITHOUT RENAMING THE FILES BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL NAMES, YOUR MOUSE AND KEYBOARD **WILL NOT WORK**. You will need to use advanced recovery methods to fix your system. Proceed with extreme caution.

The `Interception` driver is still required for the program to run. We are actively seeking a better solution.
